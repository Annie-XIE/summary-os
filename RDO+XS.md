### Integrating XenServer, RDO and Neutron

Citrix XenServer is a great choice of hypervisor under OpenStack, but
there is no native integration between it and RedHat's RDO packages.
This means that setting up an integrated environment using XenServer
and RDO is more difficult than it should be. This blog post aims to 
resolve that, giving a method where CentOS can be set up easily to 
use XenServer as the hypervisor.

		Environment:
			XenServer: 6.5
			CentOS: 7.0
			OpenStack: Liberty
			Network: Neutron, ML2 plugin, OVS, VLAN

##### 1. Install XenServer 6.5
Make sure SR is EXT3 (in the installer this is called XenDesktop optimised storage).

##### 2. Install OpenStack VM
With XenServer, the Nova Compute service must run in a virtual machine 
on the hypervisor that they will be controlling. As we're using CentOS 7.0 
for this environment, create a VM using the CentOS 7 template in XenCenter.
If you want to copy+paste the scripts from the rest of the blog, use the name
"CentOS_RDO" for this VM.

Install the CentOS 7.0 VM but shut it down before installing RDO.

2.1 Create network for OpenStack VM 

In single box environment, we need three networks, `Integration network`, 
`External network`, `VM network`. If you have appropriate networks for 
the above (e.g. a network that gives you external access) then rename 
the existing network to have the appropriate name-label. 
Note that a helper script 
[rdo_xenserver_helper.sh](https://github.com/Annie-XIE/summary-os/blob/master/rdo_xenserver_helper.sh) 
is provided for some of the later steps in this blog rely on these specific
name labels, so if you chose not to use them then please also update the helper script.

You can do this via XenCenter or run the following commands in dom0:

		xe network-create name-label=openstack-int-network
		xe network-create name-label=openstack-ext-network
		xe network-create name-label=openstack-vm-network

2.2 Create virtual network interfaces for OpenStack VM

This step requires the VM to be shut down, as it's modifying the
network setup and the PV tools have not been installed in the guest.

    xe vif-create device=autodetect network-uuid=$int_net_uuid vm-uuid=$vm_uuid
    xe vif-plug uuid=$vif_uuid_vm_net
    xe vif-create device=autodetect network-uuid=$ext_net_uuid vm-uuid=$vm_uuid
    xe vif-plug uuid=$vif_uuid_ext_net

##### 3. Install RDO
3.1 [RDO Quickstart](https://www.rdoproject.org/Quickstart) gives detailed 
installation guide, please follow the instruction step by step. 
This manual has points out the ones that must pay attation during installation.

3.2 `Step 3: Run Packstack to install OpenStack`. 

Rather than running packstack immediately, we need to generate an answerfile 
so we can tweak the configuration.

Use `packstack --gen-answer-file=<ANSWER_FILE>` to generate this answer file.

Use `packstack --answer-file=<ANSWER_FILE>` to install OpenStack services.

These items in <ANSWER_FILE> should be changed as below:

    CONFIG_NEUTRON_ML2_TYPE_DRIVERS=vlan
    CONFIG_NEUTRON_ML2_TENANT_NETWORK_TYPES=vlan

These items <ANSWER_FILE> should be changed according to your environment:

    CONFIG_NEUTRON_ML2_VLAN_RANGES=<physnet1:1000:1050>
    CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGE_MAPPINGS=<physnet1:br-eth1,phyext:br-ex>
    CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_BRIDGE_IFACES=<br-eth1:eth1,br-ex:eth2>

`physnet1` is physical network name, you can use other name instead. 

`1000:1050` is VLAN tag ranges for tenant networks.

`physnet1:br-eth1` br-eth1 is bridge for VM network

`phyext:br-ex` br-ex is the bridge for external network

##### 5. Configure Nova and Neutron

5.1 Copy Nova and Neutron plugins to XenServer host.

You can use [rdo_xenserver_helper.sh](https://github.com/Annie-XIE/summary-os/blob/master/rdo_xenserver_helper.sh)
to do this work

		install_dom0_plugins <dom0_ip>

5.2 Edit /etc/nova/nova.conf, switch compute driver to XenServer. 

    [DEFAULT]
    compute_driver=xenapi.XenAPIDriver

    [xenserver]
    connection_url=http://<dom0_ip>
    connection_username=root
    connection_password=<password>
    vif_driver=nova.virt.xenapi.vif.XenAPIOpenVswitchDriver
    ovs_int_bridge=<integration network bridge>

**Note:**
*The integration_bridge above can be found from dom0:*

`xe network-list name-label=openstack-int-network params=bridge`

5.3 Install XenAPI Python XML RPC lightweight bindings.

    yum install -y python-pip
    pip install xenapi

5.4 Configure Neutron

Edit */etc/neutron/rootwrap.conf* to support uing XenServer remotely.

    [xenapi]
    # XenAPI configuration is only required by the L2 agent if it is to
    # target a XenServer/XCP compute host's dom0.
    xenapi_connection_url=http://<dom0_ip>
    xenapi_connection_username=root
    xenapi_connection_password=<password>
    
5.4 Restart Nova and Neutron Services

    for svc in api cert conductor compute scheduler; do \
	    service openstack-nova-$svc restart; \
    done
    
    service neutron-openvswitch-agent restar

##### 6. Launch another neutron-openvswitch-agent for talking with Dom0

For all-in-one installation, typically there should be only one neutron-openvswitch-agent.
Please refer [Deployment Model](https://github.com/Annie-XIE/summary-os/blob/master/deployment-neutron-1.png)

However, XenServer has a seperation of Dom0 and DomU and all instances' VIFs are actually 
managed by Dom0. Their corresponding OVS ports are created in Dom0. Thus, we should manually
start the other ovs agent which is in charge of these ports and is talking to Dom0, 
refer [xenserver_neutron picture](https://github.com/Annie-XIE/summary-os/blob/master/xs-neutron-deployment.png).

6.1 Create another configuration file

    cp /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/openvswitch_agent.ini /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/openvswitch_agent.ini.dom0
    
    [ovs]
    integration_bridge = xapi3
    bridge_mappings = physnet1:xapi2
    
    [agent]
    root_helper = neutron-rootwrap-xen-dom0 /etc/neutron/rootwrap.conf
    root_helper_daemon =
    minimize_polling = False
    
    [securitygroup]
    firewall_driver = neutron.agent.firewall.NoopFirewallDriver

*Note: xapi3 is integration bridge, xapi2 is vm network bridge*
`xe network-list name-label=openstack-int-network params=bridge`
`xe network-list name-label=openstack-vm-network params=bridge`

6.2 Launch neutron-openvswitch-agent

    /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/neutron-openvswitch-agent --config-file /usr/share/neutron/neutron-dist.conf --config-file /etc/neutron/neutron.conf --config-file /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/openvswitch_agent.ini.dom0 --config-dir /etc/neutron/conf.d/neutron-openvswitch-agent --log-file /var/log/neutron/openvswitch-agent.log.dom0 &

##### 7. Replace cirros guest with one set up to work for XenServer
    nova image-delete cirros
    wget http://ca.downloads.xensource.com/OpenStack/cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.vhd.tgz
    glance image-create --name cirros --container-format ovf --disk-format vhd --property vm_mode=xen --visibility public --file cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.vhd.tgz

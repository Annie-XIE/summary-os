## Mirantis 8.0 with XenServer 6.5/7.0 using Neutron VLAN

Mirantis OpenStack is the most popular distribution in IaaS area and
has 100+ enterprise customers.
XenServer as the leading open source virtualization platform, has released
its offical [Fuel](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel) plugin based on Mirantis
OpenStack 8.0, which integrates neturon and provides neutron VLAN support first time.
You can download our plugin from 
[mirantis fuel plugin](https://www.mirantis.com/validated-solution-integrations/fuel-plugins/) page.


In this blog, I will focus on network part since neutron project is introduced in
XenServer Fuel plugin for the first time. For basic Mirantis OpenStack, Mirantis Fuel
and XenServer introduction, you can refer previous
[blog post](https://github.com/citrix-openstack/blogentries/blob/master/Introduction_To_XenServer_Fuel_Plugin.md).

### 1. Neutron brief

Basically Neutron is an OpenStack project which provides "networking as a service" (NaaS)
with code-name Neutron. It's a standalone service alongside other services such as Nova (compute), 
Glance (image), Cinder (storage). It provides high level abstraction of network resources,
such as network, subnet, port, router, etc. Further it enforces SDN, delegating its implementation
and functionalities to the plugin, which is not possible in nova-network.

The picture from OpenStack offical website describes typical deployment with Neutron.

* Controller node: Provide management functions, such as API servers and scheduling
services for Nova, Neutron, Glance and Cinder. It's the central part where most standard
OpenStack services and tools run.
* Network node: Provide network sevices, runs networking plug-in, layer 2 agent,
and several layer 3 agents. Handles external connectivity for virtual machines.
    * Layer 2 services include provisioning of virtual networks and tunnels. 
    * Layer 3 services include routing, NAT, and DHCP.
* Compute node: Provide computing service, it manages the hypervisors and virtual machines.

Note: With Mirantis OpenStack, network node and controller node combined to controller node

### 2. How neutron works under XenServer

Back to XenServer and Neutron, let's start from those networks.

#### 2.1 Logical networks

With Mirantis OpenStack, there are several networks involved.

    OpenStack Public network (br-ex)
    OpenStack Private network (br-prv)
    Internal network
        OpenStack Management network (br-mgmt)
        OpenStack Storage network (br-storage)
        Fuel Admin(PXE) network (br-fw-admin)

* OpenStack Public network (br-ex): 

This network should be represented as tagged or untagged isolated L2 network
segment. Servers for external API access and providing VMs with connectivity
to/from networking outside the cloud. Floating IPs are implemented with L3
agent + NAT rules on Controller nodes

* Private network (br-prv):

This is for traffics from/to tenant VMS. Under XenServer, we use OpenvSwitch VLAN (802.1q). 
OpenStack tenant can define their own L2 private network allowing IP overlap.

* Internal network:
    * OpenStack Management network: This is targeted for openstack management, it's used
to access OpenStack services, can be tagged or untagged vlan network.
    * Storage network: This is used to provide storage services such as replication traffic
  from Ceph, can tagged or untagged vlan network.
    * Fuel Admin(PXE) network: This is used fro creating and booting new nodes.
All controller and compute nodes will boot from this PXE network and will get
its IP address via Fuel's internal dhcp server.

#### 2.2 Traffic flow

In this section, we will deeply go through on North-South/East-West traffic, explain the OVS rules underly.

* North-South network traffic: Traffic between VMs and the external network, e.g. Internet.

* East-West network traffic: Traffic between VMs.

##### 2.2.1 North-South network traffic

In the above section, we have introduced different networks used in OpenStack cloud.
Let's assume VM1 with fixed IP: 192.168.30.4, floating IP: 10.71.17.81,
when VM1 ping www.google.com, how the traffic goes.

![north-south](https://github.com/Annie-XIE/summary-os/blob/master/pic/north-south-traffic-mark.png)

* In compute node:

Step-1. VM1(eth1) sent packet out through port `tap`

Step-2. Seruity group rules on Linux bridge `qbr` handle firwalling and
stack tracking for the packages

Step-3. VM1's packages arrived port `qvo`, `internal tag 16` will be added to the packages

      Bridge br-int
        fail_mode: secure
        Port br-int
            Interface br-int
                type: internal
        Port "qvof5602d85-2e"
            tag: 16
            Interface "qvof5602d85-2e"

Step-4. VM1's package arrived port `int-br-prv` triggering openflow rules, 
`internal tag 16` was changed to `physical VLAN 1173`.

        cookie=0x0, duration=12104.028s, table=0, n_packets=257, n_bytes=27404, idle_age=88, priority=4,in_port=7,dl_vlan=16 actions=mod_vlan_vid:1173,NORMAL

* In network node:

Step-5. VM1's packages went through physical VLAN network to
network node bridge `br-int` via port `int-br-prv` triggering
openflow rules, changing `physical VLAN 1173` to `internal tag 6`.

      Bridge br-int        
        Port int-br-prv
            Interface int-br-prv
                type: patch
                options: {peer=phy-br-prv}

openflow rules:

      ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int
      NXST_FLOW reply (xid=0x4):
        cookie=0xbe6ba01de8808bce, duration=12594.481s, table=0, n_packets=253, n_bytes=29517, idle_age=131, priority=3,in_port=1,dl_vlan=1173 actions=mod_vlan_vid:6,NORMAL

Step-6. VM1's packages with `internal tag 6` went into virtual router `qr`

      Bridge br-int
        Port "tapb977f7c3-e3"
            tag: 6
            Interface "tapb977f7c3-e3"
                type: internal
        Port "qr-4742c3a4-a5"
            tag: 6
            Interface "qr-4742c3a4-a5"
                type: internal

`ip netns exec qrouter-0f23c70d-5302-422a-8862-f34486b37b5d route`

        Kernel IP routing table
        Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
        default         10.71.16.1      0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 qg-1270ddd4-bb
        10.10.0.0       *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 qr-b747d7a6-ed
        10.71.16.0      *               255.255.254.0   U     0      0        0 qg-1270ddd4-bb
        192.168.30.0    *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 qr-4742c3a4-a5

`qr` locates in linux network namespace, it's used for routing within
tenant private network. VM1's packeges were with fixed IP 192.168.30.4
at the moment, from the above route table, we can see it's `qr-4742c3a4-a5`.

Step-7. VM1' packages were SNAT and went out via gateway `qg` within namespace

       -A neutron-l3-agent-PREROUTING -d 10.71.17.81/32 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.30.4
       -A neutron-l3-agent-float-snat -s 192.168.30.4/32 -j SNAT --to-source 10.71.17.81

`ip netns exec qrouter-0f23c70d-5302-422a-8862-f34486b37b5d ifconfig`

    lo    Link encap:Local Loopback  
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1
          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)

          inet addr:10.71.17.8  Bcast:10.71.17.255  Mask:255.255.254.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::f816:3eff:fe5b:368c/64 Scope:Link

          TX packets:127 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
          RX bytes:2016118 (2.0 MB)  TX bytes:8982 (8.9 KB)

Step-8. VM1's packages finally went out through br-ex, see the physical route

        0.0.0.0         10.71.16.1      0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 br-ex
        10.20.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 br-fw-admin
        10.71.16.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.254.0   U     0      0        0 br-ex
        192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 br-mgmt
        192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 br-storage

For package back from external network to VM, vice versa.

##### 2..2 East-West network traffic

When talking about East-West traffic, the packages route will quite different
depending on where the VMs residing and whether the VMs belonging to the same tenant.

* Scenario1: VM1 and VM2 locate in the same host, belong to the same tenant network and same subnet

In this scenario, traffic from VM1 to VM2, only need the integration bridge in compute node.

![east-west](https://github.com/Annie-XIE/summary-os/blob/master/pic/East-West-traffic-mark-1.png)

* Scenario2: VM1 and VM3 locate in different hosts, belong to the same tenant network and same subnet

In this scenario, traffic from VM1 to VM3 need the physical VLAN network, no network node functionality needed

![east-west](https://github.com/Annie-XIE/summary-os/blob/master/pic/East-West-traffic-mark-2.png)

* Scenario3: Others, e.g. VM1 and VM3 with different tenant network

![east-west](https://github.com/Annie-XIE/summary-os/blob/master/pic/East-West-traffic-mark-3.png)

### 3. Future

Looking forward, we will implement VxLAN and GRE network, also enrich more neutron features,
such as VPNaaS, LBaaS, FWaaS, SDN ...
